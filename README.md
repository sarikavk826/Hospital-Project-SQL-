#  Hospital Database Project (SQL)

This project is a **SQL-based hospital management dataset and analysis** designed to explore hospital operations through structured queries. It demonstrates how SQL can be used for **healthcare analytics, reporting, and resource management**.

---

##  Project Overview
The project creates and analyzes a hospital dataset with details like:
- Hospital name & location  
- Departments  
- Number of doctors and patients  
- Admission & discharge dates  
- Medical expenses  

Using this dataset, several SQL queries are written to generate insights into hospital performance and patient statistics.

-  Average number of doctors per hospital  
-  Top 3 departments with the highest patient count  
-  Hospital with the maximum medical expenses  
-  Daily and monthly average medical expenses  
-  Longest hospital stay duration

##  SQL Concepts Used
- **DDL & DML** (Create, Insert, Select)  
- **Aggregate Functions** (`SUM`, `AVG`, `ROUND`)  
- **Grouping & Ordering** (`GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`)  
- **Date Functions** (`DATEDIFF`, `DATE_FORMAT`)
